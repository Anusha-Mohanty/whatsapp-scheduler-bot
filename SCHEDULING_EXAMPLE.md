# 📅 Future Scheduling Complete Guide

## 🎯 **How Future Scheduling Works**

Future scheduling allows you to set up **automatic recurring processing** of your message sheets. The system will check for due messages at regular intervals and send them automatically.

## 📋 **Complete Scenario Example**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet**

Create a sheet called `Messages_anusha` with this data:

| Phone Numbers | Message Text | Time | Campaign Name | Run | Status |
|---------------|--------------|------|---------------|-----|--------|
| +1234567890 | Welcome to our service! | | Welcome Campaign | yes | |

| +5566778899 | Evening update | 18:00 | Evening Campaign | yes | |

### **Step 2: Set Up the Schedule**

2. **Choose Schedule Pattern**: "Every 10 minutes" (Option 1)
3. **Configure Options**:
   - Timezone: UTC
   - Run immediately: Yes

**What happens**: Creates a schedule that runs every 10 minutes to check for due messages.

📅 Schedule Created (Option 4)
    ↓
🔄 Every 10 minutes: Check for due messages
    ↓
📤 Send messages that are due
    ↓
📊 Count remaining messages
    ↓
🎉 Auto-stop when remaining = 0
```

## ⏰ **Time Processing Logic**

### **Instant Messages** (empty time column)
- ✅ **Sent immediately** when processed
- 🚀 **No time validation**

### **Scheduled Messages** (time in column)
- ⏰ **Only sent when current time >= scheduled time**
- 📅 **Supports various time formats**:
  - `09:00` - 9 AM today
  - `2:30 PM` - 2:30 PM today
  - `2024-01-15 14:30` - Specific date and time

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

The system tracks:
- **Total Processable**: All messages marked "yes" in Run column
- **Remaining Messages**: Messages not yet sent
- **Auto-stop Trigger**: When remaining = 0

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

1. **🔄 Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed
2. **⏰ Time-Aware**: Respects scheduled times
3. **🎉 Auto-Cleanup**: Stops when work is complete
4. **📊 Progress Tracking**: See exactly what's happening
5. **💡 Smart Detection**: Handles instant + scheduled automatically

## 🛠️ **Available Schedule Patterns**

| Option | Pattern | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `*/10 * * * *` | Every 10 minutes |
| 2 | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| 3 | `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| 4 | `0 9 * * *` | Daily at 9 AM |
| 5 | `0 18 * * *` | Daily at 6 PM |
| 6 | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9 AM |
| 7 | Custom | Your own cron expression |

## 💡 **Best Practices**

1. **📅 Plan Your Times**: Set realistic scheduled times
2. **🔄 Choose Right Interval**: 10 minutes for frequent checks, hourly for less urgent
3. **📊 Monitor Progress**: Check status dashboard regularly
4. **🎯 Use Combined Mode**: Option 3 handles both types automatically
5. **⏰ Consider Timezone**: Set correct timezone in schedule options

## 🚨 **Common Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: All Instant Messages**
- Set up schedule → All sent immediately → Auto-stop

### **Scenario 2: All Scheduled Messages**
- Set up schedule → Messages sent as times become due → Auto-stop when complete

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Messages**
- Set up schedule → Instant sent immediately, scheduled sent when due → Auto-stop when complete

### **Scenario 4: Future Dates**
- Set up schedule → Messages sent on specific dates/times → Auto-stop when complete

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Schedule Not Stopping**
- Check if all messages have "Sent" status
- Verify "Run" column is set to "yes"
- Look for error messages in console

### **Messages Not Sending**
- Verify current time vs scheduled time
- Check phone number format
- Ensure WhatsApp client is connected

### **Wrong Times**
- Check timezone settings
- Verify time format in sheet
- Use 24-hour format for clarity
